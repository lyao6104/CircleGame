# CircleGame

A game with circles. Move around and run into circles smaller than you to grow, and avoid AI circles larger than you.

This build features two maps: a simple grid map with 4 AI circles and a spawner, as well as a map set in space with two spawners and unique movement mechanics.

At this point, the AI will attempt to avoid other circles that are larger than it, but it is still not very smart. That being said, the AI should still offer a bit of a challenge to the player.

## Controls

WASD or Arrow Keys to move.

## Web Version
